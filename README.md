# -PritPatel-BugReports

This repository contains bug reports and feature requests for various software applications.
I decided to make this is behind improve and enhanced the user experience as well as for Companies,
because some times companies not able to capture thoes bugs which are very silly but disturb the user's experience.
In this Repository i made 2 bug report and 2 feature request for 4 different application and different platforms.
In 1st Bug report i talked about TaskMaster Application.
then, in 2nd bug report i posted issue about very known application Snapchat.Main reasons behind is Snpchat have one of the highest Bugs in terms of popular application.
Further, In Feature Request i talked about 2 major application one is Uber Eats and second one is Spotify these application are widely famous and they have some noticable lack of features.

** Note **

One thing i want to mention is i do not have idea to make issues on main branch or creating a new branch for that so if you want to see all steps please refer the commits section or main overview directory.
