Feature request related to a problem? Please describe:

Absolutely, and as an everyday user of Spotify, in most cases, it is very hard to actually find new podcasts that would clearly be of interest to me. I have to find these new podcasts or luck out on friends making recommendations, and either way, it's going to be time-consuming and not likely to match my interests.

Describe the solution :

I want Spotify to introduce a feature of personalized discovery of podcasts. This feature applies to the use of its machine-learning algorithms to take a look over my listening history and suggest fresh podcasts available and might interest me. This feature also lets you filter the podcasts according to categories, e.g. news, sports, comedy, etc. And i want they includes more AI based things which attract more Users towards them also.

Describe alternatives :

I also wanted to look into other podcast platforms or applications that help in giving personalized recommendations. Then I wondered whether the user interface and music recommendations in Spotify are much better compared to alternative that's why i want to stuck at Spotify.

Additional context :

Spotify has a podcasts section for a while, but it lacked two very important features. There were no recommendations for every user, as in the case of music, and there was no categorization. Recommendation and categorization would add a lot of value to the user and make the user even stickier.
