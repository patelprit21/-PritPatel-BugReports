feature request related to a problem? Please describe:

Yes, the mobile app that I use for my grocery shopping doesn't have the ability to save the favorites for easy ordering the next time. In case I had frequently ordered the same item, it becomes problematic, as each new order will then need manual searching for the product.

Describe the solution:

I hope they have a "save favorite items" feature in their mobile app, as that would really cut down on reordering with a single click. It will literally take me seconds to be able to put all my most commonly ordered items into the cart.

Describe alternatives:

I even thought that I might do it by hand: just add items to the list myself. But then it's an unnecessary chore and takes too much time. I even thought about getting another app, but I love this current app due to user experience and the amount of features in it.

Additional context :

That is actually a feature most other grocery shopping apps offer, and it's one I think they could definitely get some value out of. Otherwise, this would only help them once and maybe not turn them into repeat customers.

The Application which i was talk about is UberEats which is very bad in order to save my favorites things in Easy order.
